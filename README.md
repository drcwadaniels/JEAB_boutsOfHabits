This repository contains data and code developed for fitting the BERM model to IRTs; specifically, it was deployed to determine whether goal-directed vs. habitual action differed in BERM parameters. 

1. STAN Code for the Model (.STAN and .exe files)
2. R Code for fitting to data featured in Thrailkill & Daniels (.Rmds)
3. Input Data for code mentioned in 2.
4. Output Data from BHA is available at [OpenScience Framework](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/BFJ5U). 
5. Knitted Markdown Files serving as Supplemental Files (.html)
