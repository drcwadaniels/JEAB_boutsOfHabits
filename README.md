Biexponential Analysis of IRTs for JEAB Thrailkill &amp; Daniels Paper

This repository contains data and code developed for fitting the BERM model to IRTs; specifically, it was deployed to determine whether goal-directed vs. habitual action differed in BERM parameters. 

1. Test Data used to develop the model (from [Romero et al. 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166432817314250))
2. STAN Code for the Model
3. R Code for fitting to the test data
