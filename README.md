Biexponential Analysis of IRTs for JEAB Thrailkill &amp; Daniels Paper

This repository contains data and code developed for fitting the BERM model to IRTs; specifically, it was deployed to determine whether goal-directed vs. habitual action differed in BERM parameters. 

1. STAN Code for the Model (.STAN and .exe files)
2. R Code for fitting to the test data (.Rmds)
3. Knitted Markdown Files to perusing Supplemental Figures (.html)
